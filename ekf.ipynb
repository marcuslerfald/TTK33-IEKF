    "With higher noise in position measurements, the EKF estimates of position starts diverging with increased rate. \n",

    "The process and measurement covariance matrices Q and R have been tuned with the low noise experiment. Usually, the R matrix can be determined directly from the measured noise covariance, while Q often needs tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the same Q for the EKF when altering the noise, assuming the change is unknown to us. In the configuration we have used, the angular rate and linear acceleration measurement noise appears in Q because they are modeled as inputs to the system, while the position measurement noise appears in R. The R matrix is calculated from the standard deviation of the known noise in our position estimate. This is often the case in practice. In this experiment, the input noise is unknown and the Q matrix is a result of tuning by hand. Looking at the plots for normalized innovation squared (NIS) and normaized estimation error squared (NEES), the filter become overconfident in the higher noise experiments. This is due to the low covariances in the tuned Q matrix relative to the actual process noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tuning was done iteratively by looking at values for NIS and NEES and their confidence bounds. The NIS is chi-square distributed with an expected value equal to the number of measurements. The NEES follows a similar distribution, with expected value equal to the number of states. By calculating bounds for a confidence interval for these distributions and comparing them to the NIS/NEES, we determine the filter consistency. If the NIS/NEES falls within the bounds at a given timestep *k*, we can be 95% certain that the filter is consistent at *k*. If the NIS/NEES is *below* the lower bound, the filter is *underconfident*. If it is *above*, it is *overconfident*. We can use this fact to determine whether the elements of Q (and R) matrix should be decreased or increased. In practice, one is often limited to analyzing the NIS only because the NEES calculation depends on an available ground truth. In this experiment, we could imagine an approximate ground truth being available through RTK GNSS or motion capture systems.\n"
